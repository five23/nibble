Nibble

An experimental scripting synthesizer, inspired by Viznut's Bytebeat phenomenon.

This is a work in progress, primarily written for my own personal enjoyment, exploration, and education.

There is much room for optimization, and I am still tinkering with different methods of bit and sample rate conversion, so any suggestions
or comments are absolutely welcome.
